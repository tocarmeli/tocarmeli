# Hello there

## My name is Tomer, and I am a curious, fast-learner, and self-motivated junior (class of 2026) Computer Engineering and Applied Math student at UMass-Amherst.

## Objective
### I am currently looking for an internship in software engineering, systems, or electrical engineering for the summer of 2025. Previously, I worked at ISO New England as an intern, where I was tasked with modeling and representing data on electric capacity limits for the Resource Adequacy team. I also worked on various Python projects with the Environmental Studies and Planning team, helping them predict what the power grid will look like in the future. I am excited to apply what I learned throughout school to the real world.  If you have any questions, you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tocarmeli/)!
