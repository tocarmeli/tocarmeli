# Hello there

## My name is Tomer, and I am a curious, fast-learner, and self-motivated dual M.S/B.S (class of 2027) Computer Engineering and Applied Math student at UMass-Amherst.

## Objective
### I am currently looking for an internship in the following fields for the summer of 2025: digital design, design verification, FPGA engineering, embedded systems, firmware, and hardware engineering. Previously, I have worked at CommScope and ISO New England as a software engineer intern. At CommScope, I analyzed modem data and automated server-side interactions for various companies. During my prior internship at ISO New England, I was tasked with modeling and representing data on electric capacity limits for the Resource Adequacy team. I also worked on various Python projects with the Environmental Studies and Planning team, helping them predict what the power grid will look like in the future. I am excited to apply what I learned throughout school to the real world.  If you have any questions, you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tocarmeli/)!
